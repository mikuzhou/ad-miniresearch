# Problem 21: Concurrent File Processing
#
# Description: Create a program that concurrently processes a batch of files.
#
# Requirements:
#
# Implement a file processing system that allows multiple files to be processed concurrently.
# Ensure that files are processed correctly and concurrently.
# Test Set:
#
# Provide a set of files for processing.
# Execute file processing functions concurrently.
# Verify that all files are processed correctly.
class FileProcessor:
    def __init__(self):
        self.processed_files = []
        self.lock = threading.Lock()

    def process_file(self, file_path):
        with self.lock:
            # Implement file processing logic here
            self.processed_files.append(file_path)

    file_paths = ["file1.txt", "file2.txt", "file3.txt"]

    # Execute the provided solution_code in separate threads
    def execute_solution(file_path):
        exec(solution_code)

    with concurrent.futures.ThreadPoolExecutor() as executor:
        for file_path in file_paths:
            executor.submit(execute_solution, file_path)

    # Verify the correctness of file processing
    assert all(file_path in file_processor.processed_files for file_path in file_paths), "Incorrect file processing"

    # Run Pylint and ThreadSanitizer
    pylint_output = subprocess.getoutput(f"pylint {solution_code}")
    threadsanitizer_output = subprocess.getoutput(f"ThreadSanitizer {solution_code}")

    # Calculate a score based on pylint and threadsanitizer results
    pylint_score = extract_pylint_score(pylint_output) * 10.0  # Implement your scoring logic
    threadsanitizer_score = score_python_code(threadsanitizer_output)  # Implement your scoring logic

    # Calculate the final score
    final_score = (pylint_score + threadsanitizer_score*9) / 20

    # Output the final score
    print(f"Final Score: {final_score}")
