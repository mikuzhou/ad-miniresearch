# Problem 16: Concurrent Web Scraping
#
# Description: Develop a program to scrape data concurrently from multiple websites.
#
# Requirements:
#
# Implement a web scraping system that allows multiple websites to be scraped concurrently.
# Ensure that data is scraped correctly and concurrently.
# Test Set:
#
# Provide a list of URLs to websites for scraping.
# Execute scraping functions concurrently.
# Verify that the scraped data is correct.
