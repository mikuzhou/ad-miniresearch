problem = "Description: Create a program to concurrently compress multiple files using different compression algorithms.\
\
Requirements:\
\
Implement a file compression system that allows multiple files to be compressed concurrently using different algorithms.\
Ensure that file compression is performed correctly and concurrently.\
Test Set:\
\
Provide a list of files and compression algorithms.\
Execute compression functions concurrently.\
Verify that all files are compressed correctly."
