# Problem 59: Concurrent Social Media Posting

problem = "Description: Develop a program to concurrently post updates to multiple social media platforms.\
\
Requirements:\
\
Implement a social media posting system that allows multiple posts to be made concurrently.\
Ensure that posts are published correctly and concurrently.\
Test Set:\
\
Provide a list of posts and social media platforms to target.\
Execute posting functions concurrently.\
Verify that all posts are published correctly."
