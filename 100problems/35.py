# Problem 33: Concurrent Game Simulation
#
# Description: Design a program that simulates a game concurrently.
#
# Requirements:
#
# Implement a game simulation system that allows multiple players to interact with the game concurrently.
# Ensure that the game simulation is performed correctly and concurrently.
# Test Set:
#
# Define a set of game scenarios with multiple players.
# Execute game simulation functions concurrently.
# Verify that the game simulation results are correct.
