# Problem 81: Concurrent Image Rendering
#
problem = "Description: Develop a program to concurrently render multiple images using different rendering techniques.\
\
Requirements:\
\
Implement an image rendering system that allows multiple images to be rendered concurrently with various techniques.\
Ensure that image rendering is performed correctly and concurrently.\
Test Set:\
\
Provide a list of image files and rendering techniques (e.g., ray tracing, rasterization).\
Execute rendering functions concurrently.\
Verify that rendered images are saved correctly."
