# Problem 33: Concurrent Email Sending

problem = "Description: Develop a program that sends emails concurrently to multiple recipients.\
\
Requirements:\
\
Implement an email sending system that allows multiple emails to be sent concurrently to different recipients.\
Ensure that emails are sent correctly and concurrently.\
Test Set:\
\
Provide a list of recipient emails and email content.\
Execute email sending functions concurrently.\
Verify that all emails are sent correctly to their respective recipients."
