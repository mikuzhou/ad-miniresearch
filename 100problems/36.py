# Problem 31: Concurrent Website Scraping
#
problem = "Description: Design a program that scrapes information from multiple websites concurrently.\
\
Requirements:\
\
Implement a web scraping system that allows multiple websites to be scraped concurrently.\
Ensure that website data is scraped correctly and concurrently.\
Test Set:\
\
Provide a list of URLs for websites to scrape.\
Execute web scraping functions concurrently.\
Verify that the data from all websites is scraped correctly."
