problem = "Description: Develop a program to recognize objects in images concurrently.\
\
Requirements:\
\
Implement an image recognition system that allows multiple images to be analyzed for objects concurrently.\
Ensure that object recognition is performed correctly and concurrently.\
Test Set:\
\
Provide a set of images for object recognition.\
Execute object recognition functions concurrently.\
Verify that objects in all images are recognized correctly."
