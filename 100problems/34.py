# Problem 32: Concurrent Image Recognition
#
# Description: Develop a program to recognize objects in images concurrently.
#
# Requirements:
#
# Implement an image recognition system that allows multiple images to be analyzed for objects concurrently.
# Ensure that object recognition is performed correctly and concurrently.
# Test Set:
#
# Provide a set of images for object recognition.
# Execute object recognition functions concurrently.
# Verify that objects in all images are recognized correctly.
class ImageRecognizer:
    def __init__(self):
        self.recognized_objects = []
        self.lock = threading.Lock()

        with self.lock:
            # Implement object recognition logic here

    with concurrent.futures.ThreadPoolExecutor() as executor:
        for image_path in image_paths:
            executor.submit(execute_solution, image_path)

    # Verify the correctness of object recognition
    assert all(image_path in image_recognizer.recognized_objects for image_path in image_paths), "Incorrect object recognition"

    # Run Pylint and ThreadSanitizer
    pylint_output = subprocess.getoutput(f"pylint {solution_code}")
    threadsanitizer_output = subprocess.getoutput(f"ThreadSanitizer {solution_code}")

    pylint_score = extract_pylint_score(pylint_output) * 10.0  # Implement your scoring logic
    threadsanitizer_score = score_python_code(threadsanitizer_output)  # Implement your scoring logic

    # Calculate the final score
    final_score = (pylint_score + threadsanitizer_score*9) / 20

    # Output the final score
