# Problem 37: Concurrent Search Engine
#
problem = "Description: Design a concurrent search engine that searches multiple search engines concurrently and aggregates the results.\
\
Requirements:\
\
Implement a concurrent search engine that allows multiple search queries to be executed on multiple search engines concurrently.\
Ensure that search results are aggregated correctly and concurrently.\
Test Set:\
\
Provide a list of search queries and search engines.\
Execute search functions concurrently.\
Verify that search results are correctly aggregated."
