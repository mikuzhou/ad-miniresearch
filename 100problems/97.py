# Problem 93: Concurrent Video Processing
#
problem = "Description: Develop a program to concurrently process video data, such as encoding, decoding, and editing.\
\
Requirements:\
\
Implement a video processing system that allows multiple video files to be processed concurrently with different tasks.\
Ensure that video processing tasks are performed correctly and concurrently.\
Test Set:\
\
Provide a list of video files and processing tasks (e.g., encode, edit, decode).\
Execute processing functions concurrently.\
Verify that processed videos are saved correctly."
