problem = "Description: Create a program to concurrently simulate stock trading by multiple traders.\
\
Requirements:\
\
Implement a stock trading system that allows multiple traders to buy and sell stocks concurrently.\
Ensure that stock transactions are executed correctly and concurrently.\
Test Set:\
\
Provide a list of buy and sell orders from multiple traders.\
Execute trading functions concurrently.\
Verify that stock transactions are processed correctly."
