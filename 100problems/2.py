# Automated Testing Python Code (Simplified):
problem = "Description: Build a program that processes multiple text files concurrently.\

Requirements:\
\
Implement a function to process text files concurrently.\
Allow multiple threads to process files concurrently.\
Ensure accurate file processing and thread-safety.\
Test Set:[\"file1.txt", "file2.txt", "file3.txt\"]\
\
Read and process the content of multiple text files and return their combined length."
