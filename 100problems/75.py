# Problem 70: Concurrent Image Recognition
#
# Description: Build a program to concurrently recognize objects in multiple images.
#
# Requirements:
#
# Implement an image recognition system that allows multiple images to be processed concurrently.
# Ensure that object recognition is performed correctly and concurrently.
# Test Set:
#
# Provide a list of images and object recognition tasks.
# Execute recognition functions concurrently.
# Verify that objects are recognized correctly in all images.
