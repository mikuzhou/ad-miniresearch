# Problem 92: Concurrent IoT Device Control
#
problem = "Description: Build a program to concurrently control IoT devices and collect data from them.\
\
Requirements:\
\
Implement an IoT device control system that allows multiple IoT devices to be controlled and monitored concurrently.\
Ensure that IoT device control and data collection are performed correctly and concurrently.\
Test Set:\
\
Provide a list of IoT devices and control tasks (e.g., turn on/off, collect sensor data).\
Execute control and data collection functions concurrently.\
Verify that IoT devices are controlled correctly and data is collected accurately."
