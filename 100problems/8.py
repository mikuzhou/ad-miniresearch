# Problem 8: Concurrent Text Analysis
#
# Description: Build a program that analyzes multiple text documents concurrently.
#
# Requirements:
#
# Implement a text analysis system that allows multiple documents to be processed concurrently.
# Extract specific information from each document.
# Ensure correct text analysis and concurrency.
# Test Set:
#
# Provide a set of text documents.
# Execute text analysis functions concurrently to extract information (e.g., word count, keyword frequency) from each document.
# Verify the accuracy of the extracted information.
class TextAnalyzer:
    def __init__(self):
        self.analysis_results = []
        self.lock = threading.Lock()

    # Verify the correctness of text analysis results
    expected_results = [5, 5, 3]  # Expected word counts for the provided text documents
    assert text_analyzer.analysis_results == expected_results, "Incorrect analysis results"

    pylint_score = extract_pylint_score(pylint_output) * 10.0  # Implement your scoring logic
    threadsanitizer_score = score_python_code(threadsanitizer_output)  # Implement your scoring logic

    # Calculate the final score
    final_score = (pylint_score + threadsanitizer_score*9) / 20
