# Problem 75: Concurrent Database Queries
#
# Description: Develop a program to concurrently query a database for data from multiple clients.
#
# Requirements:
#
# Implement a database query system that allows multiple clients to query a database concurrently.
# Ensure that database queries are executed correctly and concurrently.
# Test Set:
#
# Provide a list of queries from multiple clients.
# Execute query functions concurrently.
# Verify that data is retrieved correctly for all clients.
