# Problem 39: Concurrent Search Engine

problem = "Description: Build a program for concurrent searching across multiple data sources.\
\
Requirements:\
\
Implement a search engine that allows multiple search queries to be executed concurrently across various data sources.\
Ensure that search queries are processed correctly and concurrently.\
Test Set:\
\
Provide a list of search queries and data sources to search.\
Execute search queries concurrently.\
Verify that search results are accurate."
