\
Requirements:\
\
Implement a web crawling system that allows multiple web pages to be crawled concurrently.\
Ensure that web pages are crawled correctly and concurrently.\
Test Set:\
\
Provide a set of web pages for crawling.\
Execute web crawling functions concurrently.\
Verify that all web pages are crawled correctly."
