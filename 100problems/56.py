# Problem 48: Concurrent E-commerce Orders

problem = "Description: Build a program to concurrently process e-commerce orders.\
\
Requirements:\
\
Implement an e-commerce order processing system that allows multiple customer orders to be processed concurrently.\
Ensure that orders are processed correctly and concurrently.\
Test Set:\
\
Provide a list of customer orders with details.\
Execute order processing functions concurrently.\
Verify that all orders are processed correctly."
