# Problem 36: Concurrent Log Processing
#
problem = "Description: Design a program to concurrently process logs from multiple sources.\
\
Requirements:\
\
Implement a log processing system that allows logs from various sources to be processed concurrently.\
Ensure that log processing is performed correctly and concurrently.\
Test Set:\
\
Provide log data from multiple sources.\
Execute log processing functions concurrently.\
Verify that all logs are processed correctly."
