# Problem 35: Concurrent Stock Trading
#
problem = "Description: Design a program for concurrent stock trading operations.\
\
Requirements:\
\
Implement a stock trading system that allows multiple users to buy and sell stocks concurrently.\
Ensure that stock trading operations are performed correctly and concurrently.\
Test Set:\
\
Provide a list of stock trading operations (buy/sell) from multiple users.\
Execute stock trading functions concurrently.\
Verify that all stock trading operations are executed correctly."
