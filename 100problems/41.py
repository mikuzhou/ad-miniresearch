# Problem 36: Concurrent File Compression

problem = "Description: Develop a program that concurrently compresses multiple files.\
\
Requirements:\
\
Implement a file compression system that allows multiple files to be compressed concurrently.\
Ensure that files are compressed correctly and concurrently.\
Test Set:\
\
Provide a list of files to be compressed.\
Execute file compression functions concurrently.\
Verify that all files are compressed correctly."
