\
Requirements:\
\
Implement a music playback system that allows multiple audio tracks to be played concurrently.\
Ensure that audio tracks are played correctly and concurrently.\
Test Set:\
\
Provide a list of audio tracks to play.\
Execute music playback functions concurrently.\
Verify that all audio tracks are played correctly."
