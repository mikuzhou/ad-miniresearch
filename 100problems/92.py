# Problem 88: Concurrent Social Media Posts
#
# Description: Build a program to concurrently post messages to multiple social media platforms.
#
# Requirements:
#
# Implement a social media posting system that allows multiple messages to be posted concurrently to different platforms.
# Ensure that messages are posted correctly and concurrently.
# Test Set:
#
# Provide a list of messages and target social media platforms (e.g., Twitter, Facebook).
# Execute posting functions concurrently.
# Verify that messages are posted correctly.
