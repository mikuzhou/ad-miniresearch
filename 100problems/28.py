# Problem 26: Concurrent Image Filtering
#
problem=  "Description: Develop a program that applies filters concurrently to a batch of images.\
\
Requirements:\
\
Implement an image filtering system that allows multiple images to be processed concurrently.\
Ensure that image filters are applied correctly and concurrently.\
Test Set:\
\
Provide a set of images for filtering.\
Execute image filtering functions concurrently.\
Verify that all images are filtered correctly."
