# Problem 38: Concurrent Game Server
#
# Description: Develop a program for a concurrent game server.
#
# Requirements:
#
# Implement a game server that allows multiple players to interact concurrently in an online game.
# Ensure that player actions and interactions are processed correctly and concurrently.
# Test Set:
#
# Simulate multiple players interacting with the game server concurrently.
# Verify that player actions and interactions are processed correctly.

            # Implement game server logic here

    assert all((player_id, action) in game_server.player_actions for player_id, action in player_actions), "Incorrect player actions"

    pylint_score = extract_pylint_score(pylint_output) * 10.0  # Implement your scoring logic

    # Calculate the final score
    final_score = (pylint_score + threadsanitizer_score*9) / 20
