# Problem 46: Concurrent Sensor Readings
#
problem = "Description: Develop a program to concurrently collect sensor readings from multiple sensors.\
\
Requirements:\
\
Implement a sensor reading system that allows multiple sensors to collect and report readings concurrently.\
Ensure that sensor readings are collected correctly and concurrently.\
Test Set:\
\
Provide a list of sensors and their readings.\
Execute sensor reading functions concurrently.\
Verify that all sensor readings are collected correctly."
