# Problem 71: Concurrent Social Media Posting
#
# Description: Create a program to concurrently post updates on multiple social media platforms.
#
# Requirements:
#
# Implement a social media posting system that allows multiple posts to be made on different platforms concurrently.
# Ensure that posts are made correctly and concurrently.
# Test Set:
#
# Provide a list of posts and target social media platforms.
# Execute posting functions concurrently.
# Verify that posts are successfully posted on all platforms.
# python
