# Problem 63: Concurrent Stock Analysis
#
# Description: Create a program to concurrently analyze the stock market data for multiple companies.
#
# Requirements:
#
# Implement a stock analysis system that allows multiple companies' stock data to be analyzed concurrently.
# Ensure that stock analysis is performed correctly and concurrently.
# Test Set:
#
# Provide a list of companies and analysis tasks.
# Execute analysis functions concurrently.
# Verify that all analysis tasks are completed correctly.
