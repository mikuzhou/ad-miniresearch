# Problem 79: Concurrent Task Execution

problem = "Description: Develop a program to concurrently execute a batch of computational tasks.\
\
Requirements:\
\
Implement a task execution system that allows multiple computational tasks to be executed concurrently.\
Ensure that tasks are executed correctly and concurrently.\
Test Set:\
\
Provide a list of tasks that need to be executed.\
Execute tasks concurrently and capture their results.\
Verify that tasks are executed correctly."
