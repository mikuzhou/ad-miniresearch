# Problem 32: Concurrent Image Uploads
#
# Description: Create a program that concurrently uploads images to multiple servers.
#
# Requirements:
#
# Implement an image uploading system that allows multiple images to be uploaded concurrently to different servers.
# Ensure that images are uploaded correctly and concurrently.
# Test Set:
#
# Provide a list of images to upload and the target servers.
# Execute image uploading functions concurrently.
# Verify that all images are uploaded correctly to their respective servers.
