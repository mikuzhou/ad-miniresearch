# Problem 29: Concurrent Video Rendering
#
# Description: Design a program to render multiple videos concurrently.
#
# Requirements:
#
# Implement a video rendering system that allows multiple videos to be rendered concurrently.
# Ensure that video rendering is performed correctly and concurrently.
# Test Set:
#
# Provide a list of video rendering tasks.
# Execute video rendering functions concurrently.
# Verify that all videos are rendered correctly.
class VideoRenderer:
    def __init__(self):
        self.rendered_videos = []
        self.lock = threading.Lock()

    def render_video(self, video_name):
        with self.lock:
            # Implement video rendering logic here
            self.rendered_videos.append(video_name)

    with concurrent.futures.ThreadPoolExecutor() as executor:
        for video_name in video_tasks:
            executor.submit(execute_solution, video_name)

    # Verify the correctness of video rendering
    assert all(video_name in video_renderer.rendered_videos for video_name in video_tasks), "Incorrect video rendering"

    # Run Pylint and ThreadSanitizer
    pylint_output = subprocess.getoutput(f"pylint {solution_code}")
    threadsanitizer_output = subprocess.getoutput(f"ThreadSanitizer {solution_code}")

    # Calculate a score based on pylint and threadsanitizer results
    pylint_score = extract_pylint_score(pylint_output) * 10.0  # Implement your scoring logic
    threadsanitizer_score = score_python_code(threadsanitizer_output)  # Implement your scoring logic

    # Calculate the final score
    final_score = (pylint_score + threadsanitizer_score*9) / 20

    # Output the final score
    print(f"Final Score: {final_score}")
