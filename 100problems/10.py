# Problem 10: Concurrent Resource Allocation
#
# Description: Develop a program that allocates and manages resources concurrently.
#
# Requirements:
#
# Implement a resource allocation system that allows multiple threads to request and release resources.
# Ensure that resource allocation and release are handled correctly and concurrently.
# Test Set:
#
# Simulate multiple threads requesting and releasing resources.
# Verify that the resource allocation and release are handled correctly, considering resource limits.
