# Problem 91: Concurrent Stock Analysis
#
problem = "Description: Develop a program to concurrently analyze stock data from multiple sources and make buying or selling decisions.\
\
Requirements:\
\
Implement a stock analysis system that allows multiple stock data sources to be analyzed concurrently.\
Ensure that stock analysis and trading decisions are performed correctly and concurrently.\
Test Set:\
\
Provide a list of stock data sources and analysis tasks (e.g., analyze trends, make buy/sell decisions).\
Execute analysis and trading functions concurrently.\
Verify that trading decisions are correct."
