Requirements:\
\
Implement a web scraping system that allows multiple websites to be scraped concurrently.\
Ensure that data scraping is performed correctly and concurrently.\
Test Set:\
\
Provide a list of websites to scrape.\
Execute scraping functions concurrently.\
Verify that all required data is scraped correctly."
