\
Requirements:\
\
Implement a web scraping system that allows multiple web pages to be fetched concurrently.\
Ensure that web pages are fetched correctly and concurrently.\
Test Set:\
\
Provide a list of URLs to fetch data from.\
Execute web scraping functions concurrently.\
Verify that data is fetched correctly."
