\
Requirements:\
\
Implement a video editing system that allows multiple video files to be edited concurrently.\
Ensure that video editing operations are performed correctly and concurrently.\
Test Set:\
\
Provide a list of video files and editing tasks.\
Execute video editing functions concurrently.\
Verify that all video files are edited correctly."
