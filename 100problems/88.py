# Problem 84: Concurrent Image Recognition
#
problem = "Description: Develop a program to concurrently recognize objects in multiple images using different image recognition algorithms.\
\
Requirements:\
\
Implement an image recognition system that allows multiple images to be analyzed concurrently with various recognition algorithms.\
Ensure that object recognition is performed correctly and concurrently.\
Test Set:\
\
Provide a list of image files and recognition tasks (e.g., object detection, facial recognition).\
Execute recognition functions concurrently.\
Verify that recognized objects are saved correctly."
