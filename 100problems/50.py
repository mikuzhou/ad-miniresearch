Requirements:\
\
Implement an image processing system that allows multiple images to be processed concurrently.\
Ensure that image processing is performed correctly and concurrently.\
Test Set:\
\
Provide a list of image files to process.\
Execute image processing functions concurrently.\
Verify that all images are processed correctly."
