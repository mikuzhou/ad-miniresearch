problem = "Description: Develop a program to concurrently back up multiple files to a backup server.\
\
Requirements:\
\
Implement a file backup system that allows multiple files to be backed up concurrently.\
Ensure that file backups are performed correctly and concurrently.\
Test Set:\
\
Provide a list of files to be backed up.\
Execute backup functions concurrently.\
Verify that files are backed up correctly."
